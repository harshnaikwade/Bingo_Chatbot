# Bingo Chatbot

A chatbot built using Python leverages technologies like Flask, Numpy, and NLTK to provide an interactive chat interface. The chatbot uses natural language processing techniques to understand user inputs and provide personalized answers based on its assigned functionality.

The chatbot's functionality can be customized to suit various use cases. For example, it can be trained to answer frequently asked questions, provide product recommendations, or assist with customer support. By using Flask, the chatbot's interface is both intuitive and easy to use, making it a valuable tool for engaging with customers or users.

I'm proud of how this project challenged me to leverage various technologies and programming techniques to build a sophisticated chatbot that can understand natural language and provide intelligent responses. The chatbot's flexibility means that it has the potential to be used in a wide range of applications, and I look forward to exploring its potential further.
